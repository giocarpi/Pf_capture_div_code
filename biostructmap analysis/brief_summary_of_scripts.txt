Brief description of scripts used in the analysis of vaccine candidates

--- Scripts ---
modify_pdb.R
	Trimming fasta and pdb files to structured domains of proteins -- 
	especially needed for AlphaFold models to trim off signal peptides, and
	unresolved loop domains. Data stored in Final fasta folder.

antibody_target_interfaces.R
	Extracting the antibody-antigen interfaces for deposited structures in pdb.
	Saves updated pdb for vizualizing pdbs, and saves tibble of interface residues
	per antibody.

run_tajima.py
	Hosted in conda environment running Biostructmap package,
	included here for completeness. Data from final_fasta folder is
	uploaded to conda environment, and output of biostructmap is stored
	in tajima_d_models folder.

tajima_d_models/scale_up_pi_measure.R
	Nucleotide diversity values were to low to be displayed in pymol.
	This script takes log10 of original value and updates b-factor of
	pdb column with this new value.

explore_pi_results.R
	Unpack nucleotide diversity results for each protein, 
	join them into a large dataframe and save as combined_pi.rds.
	This script also annotates which residues are found to be epitopes,
	based on the results of antibody_target_interfaces.R.

explore_tajima_results.R
	Unpack tajima results. Join them to combined_pi.rds.
	Save results as combined_pi_tajima_epitope2.rds

supplemental_pi_and_taj_bins.R
	Supplemental figure comparing whole protein pi and tajimas values,
	versus the values of known epitope residues. Scores are binned to 
	aid in understanding proteins with low vs high diversity, and weak vs
	strong balancing selection

locate_variable_positions.R
	Finds positions with amino acid variability, 
	adds this information to epitope tibbles, and adds this
	information to combined_pi_tajima_epitope2.rds dataset

rds_to_csv.R
	Short script to save rds files as csv's for ease of sharing results
